# Game of life
My implementation of the Conway's Game of Life for a little game jam I participated in.

## Building
Just build gol.sln, through Visual Studio 2019 or msbuild. All libraries are provided with the repository.

The executable requires an SDL2.dll file in its directory or in PATH (debug running in Visual Studio is configured
approprietaly)
